# First Repository - First task

Hi guys!

I am Jinesh Modi. I'm participating in Google Code-in. This is my first task by ZULIP - Get comfortable with git, branches, and more with some great tutorials!

I learnt to:

- creat an open source repository
- start and manage a new branch
- change a file and commit those changes to GitHub
- open and merge a Pull Request
